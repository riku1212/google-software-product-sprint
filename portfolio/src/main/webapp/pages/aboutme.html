    Hi, my name is Inggriany and I was born in Indonesia but I am currently residing in Singapore.
    More precisely, I am currently studying at Nanyang Technological University, majoring in Mathematical Sciences 
    with a Minor in Finance. Ever since I could remember, I had always loved mathematics. I think part of it was due 
    to my mother and I did not regret it.

    However, ever since I joined univeristy, I was tempted by Computer Science by my friends, who enrolled me as a part 
    of their team in competitive programming and CTFs. It was quite fun and I was very excited in learning how mathematics 
    is applied in theoretical computer science.</div>
